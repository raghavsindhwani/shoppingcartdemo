Done with the assignment
Was one of the very good assignment with no doubt can help me to be good in this field.
Felt a lot of problems initially but with time managed to do the best possible.

There are a few topics I am not comfortable right now, I am working on them and would be happy to have assistance.
Redux store
Hooks
Context API l
And other advance topics of react
Tokens 

Few topics were learned/applied for the very first time during the assignment.
Like 
throw catch then in Axios
React router, history 
Java script asynchronous await 
And promise 
Error handling
I would be working really hard on them.
Even I used bootstrap so this was my very first time with CSS designing.

Looking forward to more assignments 
And would be working really hard on a few topics which I felt I wasn't up to the mark in terms of self-assessment.

few features are missing
few are wrongly implemented
I have worked really hard for this as this my very first assignment having a lot to implement together,
done as much as possible.

Waiting for the review as well.
